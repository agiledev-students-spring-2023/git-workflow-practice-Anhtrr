## Interesting
             
This website contains and displays all the skills required for each specific professional role in the software developement industry. This website is interesting in the way that it displays these skills: in form of a roadmap. Displaying the skills required in this way is interesting because it helps people who aspire to take on a specific software development role for their professional careers easily visualize the skills required, but also which skills are more important to the role. Additionally, the website is also interesting because it has a large number of different roadmaps specified to a software developer.
